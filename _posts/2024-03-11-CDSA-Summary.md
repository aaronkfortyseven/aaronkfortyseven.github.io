Upon starting the examination process, a letter of engagement will be provided that will clearly state all engagement details, requirements, objectives, and scope.

HTB certifications are not based on and do not include multiple-choice questions! Candidates will be required to think outside the box and correlate different data/evidence to achieve the exam's objectives. Like in real-world engagements, creativity, and in-depth knowledge will be necessary for a successful outcome.
