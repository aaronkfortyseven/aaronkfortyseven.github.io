**SOC Analyst internship**

Thinking about how the ICE internship had many takeaways

- I thought as an intern i would come in and learn, but I was coming in to create. (needed something to show for it by the end) 
Create my own projects to benefit the soc, daunting but rewarding. Given I was only a year 1 student at the time.



- Lessons learnt from password query on splunk
Refining the search based on human psychology, how they would name their lists(passwords.txt credentials.word logins.xlsx, file types.
How hard to press, not to annoy people while ensuring security. You dont want to step on anyone's toes. And people push back as well trying to justify storing passwords in cleartext. What's the right measure? You want a solution that won't be sidestepped by offline solutions like a photo shared on whatsapp, or a stickynote taped to a monitor. 
And how to filter out false positives, you have an good idea but your alert is throwing up too many false positives. and alot of work was put into tuning alerts, splunk or tanium(Endpoint detection & response EDR).
