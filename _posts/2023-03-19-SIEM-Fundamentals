**Elastic Stack**

Elastic stack can be used as a SIEM solution to collect, store, analyse and visualise security-related data from various sources. 
Such as: 
- firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- endpoints (using Logstash)

ElasticSearch configured to store and index security data, perform searches and correlations on collected security data.
Kibana used to create custom dashboards and visualisation to provide insights into security events. 

Kibana Query Language(KQL) query language designed for searching and analysing.
"More intuitive" than Elasticsearch Query DSL.

(While both KQL and regex involve pattern matching, they serve different purposes and have different syntax. KQL is more specialized for querying structured data in Elasticsearch, while regex is a more general-purpose tool for pattern matching in text data. However, some concepts, such as wildcard matching and character classes, are shared between the two, though they might be expressed differently in each language.)
