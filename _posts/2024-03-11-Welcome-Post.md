## The benefit of writing things down
A great way to procrastinate starting on a cert is to spend a day learning how to document what future-you will learn on GitHub Pages.

It's nice to pick up more GitHub-jitsu merging pull requests and managing branches for a blog.

Besides, who doesn't love good documentation?
